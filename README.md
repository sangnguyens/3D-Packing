# 3D-Packing Project
This project is a 3D Packing Optimization project in partnership with InstaDeep. 

#### Why?
Is it possible to pack shipping containers more efficiently? Save space, save time, save money - pack efficiently.
Packing efficiently has the potential to reduce shipping costs that have increased due to the increase in fuel costs, shipping containers, trucks, and shipping bottlenecks.
