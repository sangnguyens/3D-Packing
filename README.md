# 3D-Packing Project
This project is a 3D Packing Optimization project in partnership with InstaDeep. We are packing a Unit Load Device [Unit Load Device Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_load_device)

### Why?
Is it possible to pack shipping containers more efficiently? Save space, save time, save money - pack efficiently.
Packing efficiently has the potential to reduce shipping costs that have increased due to the increase in fuel costs, shipping containers, trucks, and shipping bottlenecks.

### Scope
Open-ended research questions:
* Which package do I pick next and how do I set the order of items before placing/packing?
* For an item (id: 1, length: L, width: W, height: H): Where do I place it and do I rotate it? Do I force the first package to be in the bottom-left corner?
* How do I observe and encode the current state?

### Expected Learning Outcomes
1. Building a clean RL environment in python
2. Code testing and possibly test-driven development (TDD)
3. Learning to formulate real-world use-cases into ML/RL problems
4. Learning to implement and/or use advanced ML/RL algorithms and models
